Subject: Fix check-if-root for github.com/flathub-infra/vorarbeiter

Pushing PRs to <https://github.com/flathub/org.libreoffice.LibreOffice> used to
trigger test builds on <https://buildbot.flathub.org/#/>, but has apparently
changed recently to triggering test builds on some github actions based
infrastructure, which then failed our check-if-root (see e.g.,
<https://github.com/flathub/org.libreoffice.LibreOffice/pull/323#issuecomment-2829465141>),
because systemd-detect-virt is apparently not available in those containers.
But those containers apparently do have container=flatpak in their env, so add
back the check for that from e19b67dcf5e987e58ce4252d8d1c8313d111df85 "allow
building as root inside a container without complaint" (which had been removed
by 1eb18361783a25e6c70a94564d55d4e2db7586dd "use systemd-detect-virt to detect
building as root in container").
